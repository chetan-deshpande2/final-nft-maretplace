                      <li>Combating money laundering and financing of terrorism is essential to the activities of NFTHEE.

                      <li>For the purpose of the identification process, the User shall provide a small transaction to one of NFTHEE’s bank accounts. The User’s name must exactly match the name linked to the payment method used to make the transaction in question. </li>
                      <li>The address of the wallets used in connection with the Service – for instance in order to receive cryptocurrency that was purchased by means of the Service – must be the property of the user concerned.

                      <li>By creating an account, every User expressly agrees to provide all information required by NFTHEE upon its first request for the purpose of determining the identity of every User and detecting suspicious situations.

                    <ol>
                      <li>The User is obliged to pay the costs of the NFT when purchasing the NFT on a prepayment basis via the platform. NFTHEE has no influence on the speed of such a transaction. </li>
                      <li>The User shall pay the costs at once, without setoff or suspension, within the specified payment term as stated on the invoice, to the bank account number and details of NFTHEE made known to the User.</li>
                      <li>With each transaction NFTHEE charges both the Purchaser and the Seller a fixed transaction fee of 2% of the cost of the NFT.</li>
                      <li>If the User does not fulfil his/her payment obligation within the stipulated payment term, a User being a Company is legally in default. A User being a Consumer shall first receive a written reminder with a 14 day payment term following the date of the reminder in order to nevertheless fulfil the payment obligation, with the addition of extrajudicial costs if the Consumer does not fulfil his/her obligation within said term before default occurs. From the date upon which the User is in default, NFTHEE has – without further notification of default – the right to statutory commercial interest, starting the first day of default up to the day of full payment, as well as the right to compensation of the extrajudicial costs pursuant to Article 6:96 of the Dutch Civil Code, calculated in accordance with the Dutch Extrajudicial Collection Costs (Fees) Decree of 1 July 2012 (Besluit vergoeding voor buitengerechtelijke incassokosten).</li>
                      <li>If NFTHEE has incurred higher costs which are reasonably necessary, these costs are eligible for compensation. Any incurred legal and enforcement costs will also be recovered from the User.</li>
                      <li>The User is aware and expressly agrees that every purchase is irreversible and no refunds will be provided to the User. </li>
                      <li>NFTHEE has the right to cancel a User’s purchase if at NFTHEE’s sole discretion, the transaction in question is presumed to be suspicious. A User shall then reimburse the purchasing costs, with the exception of the transaction costs. Provided the refund concerns cryptocurrency, this cryptocurrency shall be sold at the current exchange rate or at purchase value, at the sole discretion of NFTHEE. </li>

                    <ol>
                      <li>NFTHEE is not liable if, as a result of a force majeure situation, she is unable to fulfil her obligations, nor can NFTHEE be held to fulfilling any obligation provided she is hindered in doing so by a circumstance that is not attributable to fault by NFTHEE, nor can NFTHEE be held accountable by law, legal action or notions prevailing in commerce. Force majeure is taken to mean, but is not limited to the meaning given to it by the law and jurisprudence, namely (i) force majeure suffered by NFTHEE’s suppliers, (ii) inadequate compliance with obligations on the part of NFTHEE’s suppliers, (iii) defective third party items, equipment, software or materials, (iv) governmental measures, (v) electricity failure, (vi) internet failure; data network or telecommunications facilities failure (e.g. due to cybercrime and hacking), (vii) natural disasters, (viii) war and terrorist attacks, (ix) general logistic issues, (x) strikes at the NFTHEE company and (xi) other situations that in NFTHEE’s opinion fall outside the scope of NFTHEE’s influence and temporarily or permanently hinder the fulfilment of NFTHEE’s obligations.</li>
                      <li>If and insofar as no legal provision stands in the way of that, NFTHEE excludes all liability for damage suffered by the User on the grounds of (i) using NFTHEE Services, (ii) selling NFTs of other Users via the Website, (iii) the Website being unavailable, not fully available or not securely available, (iv) changes in, to or on NFTHEE’s Website and/or Services, (v) any inaccurate and/or incomplete information on the Website.</li>
                      <li>NFTHEE excludes all liability for consequential damage. </li>
                      <li>If and to the extent that NFTHEE is found to be liable, this liability is limited to the maximum amount that the User has paid to NFTHEE within the framework of the Agreement, but not more than a year (12 months) prior to the damage-causing event and limited to the maximum amount of 250 euro per claim/ event or series of claims/events per year. </li>
                      <li>All User claims due to shortcomings on behalf of NFTHEE shall expire, provided these have not been reported to NFTHEE in writing and motivated within one year after the date on which the User became aware – or could reasonably have been aware of the facts on which his/her claims are based. NFTHEE’s liability expires one year after the termination of the Agreement between the parties. </li>
