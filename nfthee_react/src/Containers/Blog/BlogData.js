              blog_detail01:"NFT phishing scams involve the fraudulent practice of pretending to be reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as their wallet’s keys or seed phrases",
              blog_detail1:"Fortunately, there’s a simple way to steer clear of phishing scams. Just double-check the address of the site where you’re entering your personal information to ensure that it’s the verified website and not a duplicate scam under a similar name",

              blog_detail_title2:"Suspicious Pop-Ups",
              blog_detail02:"When you go to a compromised website, they may open pop-ups that you never asked for. If that happens to you, never enter your wallet information into the suspicious pop-up, no matter who they are claiming to be.",
               
              blog_detail_title3:"Bidding Scams",
              blog_detail03  :"This is a clever yet fraudulent technique that some platforms use to scam their users. Bidding scams happen when someone wants to sell NFTs in a secondary market. Once they list their NFT for sale, the platform might switch your preferred currency with low-valued cryptocurrencies without informing you. This kind of scam can lead to significant losses.</br> Fortunately for you, a simple way to avoid this scam is to double-check the currency used before selling." ,    

              blog_detail_title4:"Counterfeit NFT Scams",
              blog_detail04:"These scams involve selling an imitation of a valuable NFT under pretenses. Buyers may not be aware that the NFT they’re buying is not the original, but a valueless replica. These scams often succeed because they pretend to be selling the original but at a cheaper price for a limited period. People fall prey to these scams because of the potential profit to be made.",
              blog_detail4:"To stay safe from counterfeit scams, you should research to ensure the NFT you’re buying is from the verified account of the real artist in question.",

              blog_detail_title5:"Catfishing Scams",
              blog_detail05:"Catfishing isn’t limited to social media websites. The NFT world is full of people pretending to be someone else to make deals that heavily favor them or outright steal money. <br/> If you ever receive a DM from someone who claims to be a founder of an NFT project or an influencer in the NFT space, you shouldn’t get your hopes high. You see, it’s common etiquette in the NFT world that C-level members never directly contact someone unless they had an interaction with them earlier.",
              blog_detail5 :"So unless you had an interaction with the person who sent you a DM, chances are it’s a catfisher. You should never trust such a person and you must not give them any personal details under any circumstance. We suggest that before you even respond to them, you should first check out their account and do whatever you have to verify that they are who they claim to be.",

              blog_detail_title6:"Customer Support Impersonation",
              blog_detail06:"Although these fall under the phishing scams category, we are mentioning them separately because they are more clever than your average fishing scam and people are more likely to fall for them. </br> As you can tell by the name, this scam involves someone pretending to be customer support to extract personal details from people. These NFT scammers use fake links to official-looking websites as a ruse to get access to crypto wallets by pretending to resolve account issues or even security threats.",
              blog_detail6:"Fortunately, it’s easy to keep yourself safe from these scams. All you have to do is communicate only with the official webpage or official social media platforms of the NFT marketplace in question. ",
            
              blog_detail_title7:"Pump-and-Dumps",
              blog_detail07:"In a nutshell, a pump-and-dump scheme is when a group suddenly boosts a project’s value by making false, misleading, or greatly exaggerated statements. They invest at a low rate, drive up the price by false promotion, and then sell their investments at a higher rate to unsuspecting investors who don’t have a clue that they are being manipulated into buying the asset at an unreasonable rate.",
              blog_detail7:"To avoid pump-and-dump schemes, you should check for a recent sudden boost in the values of the NFT you’re considering buying. If there is a sudden boost in its price, find out the reason behind it and see if it validates the price increase. ",

You can legally own multiple wallets to diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio. </br> The reason we recommend diversifying your portfolio is that there’s always a chance of an account getting hacked. If and when that happens, you don’t want to risk losing all your crypto due to one unfortunate hack—and owning multiple wallets is exactly what can help you avoid that. You should use one wallet for your daily transactions and keep the rest in separate wallets. Doing so will protect your portfolio and minimize the loss of any breach to your crypto accounts." ,

They targeted major cryptocurrency exchanges and stole $200 million worth of crypto in 2 years! Their attacks were performed using fake domains impersonating affiliated organizations and employees. Their main hacking source was corrupt links in documents via emails. <br/>That’s why you need to be extra careful while making crypto transactions.

Since they only have your information and they can’t physically access your device, they can’t verify the transaction to steal your hard-earned money.",

Sure, popular platforms and wallets offer state-of-the-art security protocols that help keep you safe from cyberattacks. But ultimately, safety is a shared responsibility. No matter how safe your provider is, you can still get hacked if you don’t take the following safety measures: <br/> 1.Use a safe internet connection with a VPN. </br>2.Never share your password with anyone under any circumstance.<br/> 3.Diversify your portfolio by storing your crypto in multiple wallets.<br/> 4.Store your private keys in a cold wallet. <br/> 5.Secure the device that you use for making your crypto transactions. <br/> Always keep an eye out for phishing and double-check links to ensure you’re not going to any suspicious address. </br> 6.

Depending on those factors, it can end up costing you a lot of money.<br/><br/><b>2.The Platform’s Share: </b>NFT marketplaces like Opensea and Axie take their cut on every transaction you make. Their cut can range anywhere from 2.5% to 4.5%. <br/><br/> <b>3.Registration Fee: </b> 3.: Some popular NFT marketplaces even charge you for registration. These fees vary wildly depending on the platform we are talking about. <br/> <br/>As you can imagine, those fees combined can end up costing you a lot of money. This is a big turn-off for many NFT traders. That’s why at NFThee, we are striving for low costs and high accessibility—the two qualities everyone wants in an NFT marketplace.
